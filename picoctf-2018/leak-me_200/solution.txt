Looking at the source code, we see that the program retrieves input from the user using fgets,
and replaces the newline with a null byte. However, the program does not check that the input
provided by the user is within length of the buffer, which is 256.
If we input 256 characters as our name, the null byte does not properly get placed at the end, allowing
us to read past the name buffer and into the password buffer.
