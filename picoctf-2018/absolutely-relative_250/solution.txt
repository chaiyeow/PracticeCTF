The program checks to see if we can view the contents of the flag by opening a file called "permissions.txt" in our current
working directory, and checks if the contents are "yes". Since we're not allowed to make modifications to anything
in the /problems/ folder, we can use our own home directories to place a file with the correct permissions to bypass the
permission checks.
