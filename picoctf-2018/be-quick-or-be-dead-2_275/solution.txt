Looking at the program, it appears to get the key by calculating the 1015th fibonacci number.
This is very slow, and probably won't finish in any reasonable amount of time, but we can use WolframAlpha to
find that number:
59288416551943338727574080408572281287377451615227988184724603969919549034666922046325034891393072356252090591628758887874047734579886068667306295291967872198822088710569576575629665781687543564318377549435421485

However, this is C, so we need to overflow that value appropriately, which turns it into -783768486378814675

With this, we can decrypt the flag through gdb and view it quite easily.

gdb-peda$ call (int) decrypt_flag(-783768486378814675L)
$2 = 0x39
gdb-peda$ print (char*) &flag
$3 = 0x601080 <flag> "picoCTF{the_fibonacci_sequence_can_be_done_fast_73e2451e}"
