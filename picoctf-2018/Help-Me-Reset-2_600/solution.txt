This gives us information about usernames, which we can use to reset passwords.

The password reset involves getting 3 questions right, but if you get them wrong, the account
will be "locked out". However, this doesn't actually happen on the server side, so clearing
your cookies then trying again will work.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the questions for each stage of the password reset aren't
necessarily unique, so if we're able to find the answer to any one question we can continuously
refresh each stage until we get that question again. The question I chose to brute force was
the favorite color one.
