We can use ssh-copy-id to copy our ssh public key onto the server so we don't need to continuously
input our password to authenticate

$ ssh-copy-id pico2018
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/james/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
picoCTF{who_n33ds_p4ssw0rds_38dj21}
Type your platform password and press Enter (there is no indication as you type):

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'pico2018'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
