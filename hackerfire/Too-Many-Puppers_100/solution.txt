Unzipping the given file will give us a huge maze of files. Uninterestingly enough, the
flag is in the name of one of the files. This means you could have simply run `strings` on the zip
to get the flag without viewing its contents.

$ find . | grep flag
./PxNc/TvNkzcm/UdfV/BVoAp/yHkWSGaL/bBYy/lxANKI/hgugRa/fvgXjIbXg/OSvfOVZ/vSXzvo/FSsDewdd/NFFzMKA/flag{0h_y0u've_found_me}

OR

$ strings puppy.zip | grep -o "flag{.*}"
flag{0h_y0u've_found_me}
