This problem is actually more of a recon problem than a forensics problem. Ew.

Anyways, performing a reverse image search on Google doesn't yield any results, so we need
to take a look at the image's metadata

City                            : New York City
Province-State                  : New York
Country-Primary Location Name   : Major Mark Park
...

From this, we know that the statue is Major Mark Park in NYC.
A quick Google search reveals the following monument: https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/major-mark-park/monuments/1464
The statues look the same, so we know that we found the right one.

The name of the statue is Soldiers and Sailors Monument
