Using cribdrag, we can slowly guess the words that make up the key and each of the messages.
We can start off by guessing that the key starts with "flag{", and complete the words in each message to
continue building the key.

It turns out that the encrypted strings are from "The Grand Old Duke of York" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Old_Duke_of_York),
and knowing that we can acquire the key:
