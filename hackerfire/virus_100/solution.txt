The first thing we should do is fire up wireshark to examine the traffic.
There is a lot of packets from telnet being passed around, which also includes the password
we need to retrieve.

We can use wireshark to dump the raw data from the TCP stream, which contains a lot of ansi escape codes
for color, which makes it slightly annoying to read. However, we can run `cat` on the dumped file
which will render the colors for us and make things more readable

Looking through the dump, we find that the password:
SW33t_D1SP0S1T10N
