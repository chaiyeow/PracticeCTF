In order to solve this problem, we need to understand how metadata is stored in mysql and how to perform a UNION
query.

Essentially, a UNION query allows to retrieve data from another table, but we need the number of columns returned in the union
to match the number of columns returned in the original query.

' UNION SELECT 1 --       # Triggers an error
' UNION SELECT 1, 1 --    # Triggers an error
' UNION SELECT 1, 1, 1 -- # Success!

From this, we know that we need to return 3 columns in our union query.
Next, we need to retrieve the names of all the tables in the database. We can do this by
querying table_name attributes for all the rows in the information_schema.tables table.
Remember that we need to return 3 columns in our union query, which we can do by returning table_name 3 times.

The final payload is
' UNION SELECT table_name, table_name, table_name from information_schema.tables --

All the way at the bottom, we find the flag:
flag{w3lc0me_t0_th3_m3m3side}
